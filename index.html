<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm Stacey Reiman, work at home mom with 3 adorable kids, and an app developer who recently switched from Flash to HTML5. My badly neglected  blog is here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.akwebgenius.com/blog">http://www.akwebgenius.com/blog</a></p>

<p>You can find my 20 or so apps thoughout the various app ecosystems under the name InstaSpanish as well as my own name. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instaspanish-kids-lessons/id488540338?mt=8">The Insta Spanish Kids App</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/learn-to-read-kids/id552476784?mt=8">Learn to Read Kids</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dress-the-pig/id493344970?mt=8">Dress the Pig</a> are probably my 3 most popular apps :)</p>

<p>I was one of the app developers lucky enough to receive a Samsung Series 7 Slate PC from Microsoft a little while back, and found it to be a delight to use, and quickly went about trying to set up a good development environment for it. Since I'm doing HTML5/JavaScript with a focus on compatibility with the Windows 8 store (cross platform though, as for a host of reasons I think this store is still not something developers will really benefit from). But as I love Blend for Visual Studio, I wanted something to help me access common programming keystrokes directly from the touch interface, and without cycling through the symbols area of the virtual keyboard.</p>

<p>I quickly found some fantastic resources and existing scripts, and have cobbled them together to create this still alpha stage tool. All of these are focused on graphic apps like Photoshop and Illustrator, whereas mine focuses on Blend, Sublime Text, and Notepad++, with Photoshop and Illustrator versions included that I have not customized. </p>

<p>Thanks for visiting - I hope that by putting this project on GitHub we can gather a few other folks to help improve it!  Please continue on to the GitHub page to read more and get a look at the files.  </p>
